This project demonstrates a robust CI/CD pipeline for deploying Node.js applications using Jenkins, Docker, and Amazon EKS. It automates stages from code checkout to deployment, ensuring speed, scalability, and reliability. The pipeline integrates GitHub for seamless code management, builds Docker images, provisions an EKS cluster, and deploys the application. AWS CLI and eksctl are used for managing cloud resources. The Jenkins Build Dashboard provides real-time monitoring of each pipeline stage, enhancing visibility and ensuring smooth deployment with an average build time of 18 minutes. Ideal for production environments.
